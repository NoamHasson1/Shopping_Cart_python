This Python project simulates an online shopping experience. It allows users to browse items, add them to a cart, and calculate the total cost. The project is modular and includes multiple files, each handling a different part of the system.

Main Features:

Item Management: Define products with a name and price.

Shopping Cart: Add items, view the cart, calculate total prices, and possibly remove items.

Store Logic: Acts as the central place that connects items, the cart, and user actions.

Testing: Automated unit tests ensure the cart behaves as expected.
